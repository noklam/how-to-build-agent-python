Complete File Editor Agent - Step 5 of the Python AI Agent

This is the final and most capable agent in the workshop progression.
It includes all previous tools plus file editing capabilities, making it
a fully functional agent that can read, explore, execute commands, and
modify files in the file system.

Key Learning Points:
- Complete agent capabilities with all tools
- File modification with validation and safety checks
- String replacement with ambiguity handling
- Directory creation and file management
- Comprehensive agent workflows

Usage:
    python src/apps/05_edit_tool.py
    python src/apps/05_edit_tool.py --verbose

Try asking:
    "Create a simple Python hello world script"
    "Add a comment to the top of examples/fizzbuzz.js"
    "List files, read one, and make an improvement to it"
    "Create a new file with some content and then read it back"

    Complete file editing agent with Claude.

    This is the most capable agent in the workshop, featuring all four tools:
    - read_file: Read file contents
    - list_files: Explore directory structure
    - bash: Execute shell commands
    - edit_file: Modify or create files

    This agent can perform complete development workflows, from exploring
    a codebase to making modifications and running commands.

    Key concepts demonstrated:
    - Full agent capabilities with comprehensive toolset
    - File modification with safety validations
    - Complete development workflow support
    - Tool synergy across all four capabilities
