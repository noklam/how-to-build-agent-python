File Reading Agent - Step 2 of the Python AI Agent

This application builds on the basic chat by adding the first tool: file reading.
It demonstrates how to integrate tools with the agent and shows the tool execution
pattern that all subsequent applications follow.

Key Learning Points:
- Adding tools to an agent
- Tool definition and schema generation
- Tool execution and result handling
- File system operations with error handling

Usage:
    python src/apps/02_read.py
    python src/apps/02_read.py --verbose

Try asking:
    "Read the contents of examples/riddle.txt"
    "What's in the examples/fizzbuzz.js file?"

    File reading agent with Claude.

    This application demonstrates how to add the first tool to an agent.
    The read_file tool allows Claude to read and analyze file contents,
    opening up many new possibilities for interaction.

    Key concepts demonstrated:
    - Tool registration with agent.add_tool()
    - Automatic JSON schema generation from Pydantic models
    - Error handling in tool execution
    - File path validation and security
